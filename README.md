# Django Project

Welcome to the Django project! This guide will take you from zero to hero, helping you get started with running this project on your local machine.

## Zero to Hero: Get Started with This Django Project

### 1. **Install Python**
   - If you don't already have Python installed, go to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download Python 3.x.
   - To check if Python is already installed, run the following command in your terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
     - **For macOS/Linux**:

       python3 --version
       ```
     - **For Windows**:
       ```bash
       python --version
       ```
   - If the command shows the version number, Python is already installed!

### 2. **Install Django**
